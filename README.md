**# RL_CIA**

**CIA 1: Bulid a recommender system using k arm bandit algorithm**

**CIA 2: Build an MDP based RL agent to optimise both policies and actions at every state in a 100x100 grid with obstacles in between 2 random points.**
[GRID](https://github.com/RL_CIAs/grid.png)

1.**Red cells** represent the paths where the policy has arrows indicating the optimal direction to move from each cell. The red color is used to show these arrows. /n
2.**White cells** represent the empty, walkable spaces in the grid with no obstacles or arrows.
3.**Black cells** are obstacles in the grid (represented by the value -1). These cells are impassable, and the policy cannot provide a path through them.
